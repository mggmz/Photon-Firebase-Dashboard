# Photon-Firebase-Dashboard
Photon IoT dashboard that combines Particle firmware (Photon + DHT11) with a Firebase stack—Firestore, Auth, Cloud Functions, Hosting—and a React/Tailwind front end. Out of the box it lets you stream sensor data, enforce per‑user ownership, and toggle a relay from the browser, all without managing servers.
